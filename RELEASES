  - Added support for the following Pseudo-Random Number Generators:
    - ChaCha20
  - Added support for the following hashing algorithms:
      - SHA512-256
      - SHA512-224
      - Blake2b-160
      - Blake2b-256
      - Blake2b-256
      - Blake2b-512
      - Blake2s-128
      - Blake2s-160
      - Blake2s-224
      - Blake2s-256
      - SHA3-224
      - SHA3-256
      - SHA3-384

    - Blake2s
    - Poly1305
  - Added support for the following modes of operation:
    - ChaCha20-Poly1305
    - OCB3
  - Splitted the code into various modules to make it easier to add support
    for new algorithms in the future
  - Renamed tomcrypt_strerror() into tomcrypt_error()
  - Added tomcrypt_errno() to retrieve the error number for the last
    LibTomCrypt function that failed, making tomcrypt_error() actually useful
  - Added tomcrypt_clear() to clear the last error returned by a LibTomCrypt
    function

= Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed --with-tomcrypt=/custom/path not working properly
  - Fixed the test vector used for several tests (XTEA, MULTI2, NOEKEON)

- Removed features:

  - Removed buggy (incomplete) support for the Cipher Hash Construction
  - Removed the tomcrypt_cipher_name(), tomcrypt_hash_name() and
    tomcrypt_rng_name() functions. They were pretty much useless
    since you already had to know the object's name to call them.
  - Removed buggy RC4 stream cipher implementation (a proper
    implementation is now provided with LibTomCrypt v1.18+).
