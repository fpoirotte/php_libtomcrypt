Version: 0.4.0 (API: 0.4.0)
Date: 2019-03-31 23:59:59
Stability: beta (API: stable)

notes: Sun, Mar 31, 2019 - tomcrypt 0.4.0

+ Changes:

  - Added support for PHP 7.3

  - Refactored some of the code

  - Added tomcrypt_rng_import() / tomcrypt_rng_export()
    functions to import / export a PRNG's state

  - Added TOMCRYPT_FAST boolean constant that indicates whether
    LibTomCrypt is running in "fast mode" or not.
    When running in "fast mode", LibTomCrypt will refuse to perform
    slow operations, like encrypting a block of data when the parameters
    are not aligned with the machine's native word size.

  - Added "null" family of ciphers for private use (unit tests)
    They come in two flavors:
    - "null"      is an 8-bit block cipher
    - "null-128"  is a 128-bit block cipher

  - Added tests for every type of object exposed by this extension
    (ciphers, encryption modes, hashes, MACs & RNGs)

= Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed MAC-related functions not working at all

    for MSVC/C89 compatibility.

+ Changes:

  - Improved support for LibTomCrypt v1.18
  - Added support for pkg-config
  - Added support for these Ciphers (requires LTC v1.18+)
    - Camellia (block cipher)
    - ChaCha (stream cipher)

    - Sober128 (stream cipher)
  - Added support for the ChaCha20 Pseudo-Random Number Generator
    (requires LTC v1.18+)

      - SHA512-256
      - SHA512-224
      - Blake2b-160
      - Blake2b-256
      - Blake2b-256

      - Blake2s-128
      - Blake2s-160
      - Blake2s-224
      - Blake2s-256
      - SHA3-224
      - SHA3-256
      - SHA3-384
      - SHA3-512
  - Added support for these Message Authentication Codes (requires LTC v1.18+)
    - Blake2b
    - Blake2s
    - Poly1305
  - Added support for these modes of operation (requires LTC v1.18+)
    - ChaCha20-Poly1305
    - OCB3
    - Stream (for stream ciphers)
  - Splitted the code into various modules to make it easier to add support
    for new algorithms in the future
  - Renamed tomcrypt_strerror() into tomcrypt_error()
  - Added tomcrypt_errno() to retrieve the error number for the last
    LibTomCrypt function that failed, making tomcrypt_error() actually useful
  - Added tomcrypt_clear() to clear the last error returned by a LibTomCrypt
    function
  - Added support for HKDF (Hash-based Key Derivation Function) through
    the new tomcrypt_hkdf() function (requires LTC v1.18+)

= Fixed bugs:

  - Fixed --with-tomcrypt=/custom/path not working properly
  - Fixed the test vector used for several tests (XTEA, MULTI2, NOEKEON)

- Removed features:

  - Removed buggy (incomplete) support for the Cipher Hash Construction
  - Removed the tomcrypt_cipher_name(), tomcrypt_hash_name() and
    tomcrypt_rng_name() functions. They were pretty much useless
    since you already had to know the object's name to call them.
  - Removed buggy RC4 stream cipher implementation (a proper
    implementation is now provided with LibTomCrypt v1.18+).
